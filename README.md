Cosmora – Mood-Based Spotify Music Player

Cosmora is an iOS app that enhances user well-being by integrating Spotify with mood detection. It uses voice-based emotion recognition to analyze the user’s mood and plays Spotify songs accordingly.

 How it Works:
1️⃣ The user records their voice using the Mood Capture feature.

3️⃣ Based on the detected mood, Spotify suggests and plays music.

🔗 Seamlessly connects your Spotify account with Cosmora to create an AI-driven music experience.
